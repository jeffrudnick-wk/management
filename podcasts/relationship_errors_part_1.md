Using the common enemy as a bonding method is all to common, especially with early relationships.

It's a bit lit gossip, but not good in the long term

1. Don't look for common enemies
1. Don't accept the invitation
1. Don't ignore it
1. Build relationships on positive interactions

They just appear so easy and often you don't have to look for them.
Sometimes you're just trying to get out of a relationship hole with some and use it as a common bond
It could be a project, or a packet, it doesn't have to be a person specifically.
There's them and us, and we're basing our relationship on our dislike of this "them", but it's a relationship built on shifting sands
Long term you don't know where relationships are going, so building it on negativity could come back and haunt you.
Don't have to agree with someone when they express their dislike for their printer, or that people don't put away their dishes.
It just puts you in a negative state of mind.
You're wasting energy on it
Be careful of establishing a pattern of having people come to you with their negative thoughts and energy
Relationships are not binary, there's more to them than that.
Build relationships on solid positive interactions puts you in a better place long term, more factors than just that negative common enemy 

So.uch easier to just get along with basically everyone than spending you time figuring out the relationships to figure out who like who and who doesn't like who. No need for the 3D chess

It also prevents you from seeing the positives of that thing, you might be missing an opportunity because you just dismiss it.

You can still acknowledge a person's frustration with something but shift the conversation to figure out a benefit or how to make it positive.

It also can tear down the team.
- Don't lie
- Don't tear down the team

Bad behaviors are cancerous to an organization and a team

Managers sometimes use this as a way to galvanize the team. I'll be come the common enemy so they can form relationships around having me be that enemy. I'll make myself the target.kind of a way to steer into the skid. But that's not a real team relationship. It's a one factor relationship and when that goes away there's no team beyond that.

Politics is just an outward perspective on relationships. It's the only way to get things done when you have more than one person involved.

How can you work well with everyone?
