Common enemy : I hate that printer
Invitation: you say I hate that printer too

Art is not to accept that invitation

Aim is to be neutral

There are ways to answer without disagreeing

No one is thinking about what you said three hours later except you

Example: I hate Ms office

We all know that software is frustrating, the better it gets the more frustrating it can be when something doesn't work

Instead of saying something like "it's the worst" try redirecting to figure out what's frustrating?" Or "want to take a break?"

Someone says "legal always get in our way"

You can say, "I understand how you feel, the bigger picture they're trying to look at the company, but it can be frustrating in the moment" or "I have a contact over there, want their number?"

Use feel, felt, found

Someone says "our boss is an idiot "

You could say, "I can see where you're coming from, I think where they're coming from is this..." Or "the plan doesn't make sense to me, maybe we should ask some questions "

It's about acknowledging where they're coming from but then trying to move the conversation to a more positive place.

Next point: Don't ignore it

Ignoring it is basically tolerating it by omission. If you say nothing it's assumed you agree.

Find a way to understand where they're coming from, agreeing with the feeling and put a positive spin on it

Build a relationship on positive factors takes longer and more work, but long term it's a much stronger foundation for a relationship.

Build relationships on a common goal.

If you imagine a team with a launch date vs a team that's just doing business as usual, the team with a goal has something to aim for so it increases their energy levels. But you can't always have a launch date as a common goal.

If you're a business as usual team, find a common goal.

Build relationships on assistance. Can you be the person that people come to looking for help? Maybe just to listen to, or asking for help, etc. You want to be seen as helpful.

Or build it based on caring. You can exert yourself and take on risks to move your work or organization forward.

Build relationships based on communication. You don't need to get into therapy talk. Talk about what you've done and what you're going to do.

Sprint questions:
What did you do yesterday to help the team meet their sprint goal?
What are you doing today to help the team meet that goal?
What impediments do you see coming up that could keep you from hitting that goal?

It's so easy to stand on the sidelines and criticize. It's harder to live well than it is to live easy, but it's worth it.
