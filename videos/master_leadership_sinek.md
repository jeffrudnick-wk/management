# Raw Notes
All leaders have one thing and one thing only: followers

Are people willing to follow you?

Follower: someone who chooses to go where you want to go. They volunteer.

Why should someone follow you

Two ways to influence: Either manipulate or inspire people

Most innovation is really just novelty

How do we differentiate ourselves?

How do you create trust and loyalty?

Manipulation is unfortunately the norm today

Choice is stress for both the sellers and the buyers

The alternative is inspiration

Every one of these greate leaders do these things:
The golden circle, bullseye:
Why, how, and what are the three tiers

Why = what's your purpose, why do you exist

The leaders with capacity to inspire acts from the inside out, focusing first on the why

Apple defines themselves by why they exist, whereas most companies focus on what they make.

Have to have discipline of how

Have to have consistency of what

This is the baseline for authenticity

When we're surrounded by a group of people who believe what we believe, something remarkable happens: trust

Built out of common values and beliefs

Trust allows us more ability to experiment and go beyond the norm

Great organizations and cultures can deal with stresses because of trust, others will crumble

Everything you say and do has to prove what you believe

When you're in an environment where you don't feel you belong, you search out for people sending signals that base on your trust and feel like you belong.

Sense of belonging and sense of community is so strong

Why do we not ask the questions about what people believe in when we're Interview them?

The goal is to surround yourself with people that believe in what you believe.

There's a difference between loyalty and repeat business.

Take for example Macs vs other computers
